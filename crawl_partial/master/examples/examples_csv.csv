SkNksoRctQ,Fluctuation-dissipation relations for stochastic gradient descent,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkNksoRctQ,2018-12-21,"The notion of the stationary equilibrium ensemble has played a central role in statistical mechanics. In machine learning as well, training serves as generalized equilibration that drives the probability distribution of model parameters toward stationarity. Here, we derive stationary fluctuation-dissipation relations that link measurable quantities and hyperparameters in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. These relations hold exactly for any stationary state and can in particular be used to adaptively set training schedule. We can further use the relations to efficiently extract information pertaining to a loss-function landscape such as the magnitudes of its Hessian and anharmonicity. Our claims are empirically verified.","We prove fluctuation-dissipation relations for SGD, which can be used to (i) adaptively set learning rates and (ii) probe loss surfaces.",Sho Yaida,"stochastic gradient descent,adaptive method,loss surface,Hessian",--,--,588,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkNksoRctQ,['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference'],"@inproceedings{

Byg9AR4YDB,Exploring Cellular Protein Localization Through Semantic Image Synthesis,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byg9AR4YDB,--,"Cell-cell interactions have an integral role in tumorigenesis as they are critical in governing immune responses. As such, investigating specific cell-cell interactions has the potential to not only expand upon the understanding of tumorigenesis, but also guide clinical management of patient responses to cancer immunotherapies. A recent imaging technique for exploring cell-cell interactions, multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF), allows for cells to be quantified in 36 different protein markers at sub-cellular resolutions in situ as high resolution multiplexed images. To explore the MIBI images, we propose a GAN for multiplexed data with protein specific attention. By conditioning image generation on cell types, sizes, and neighborhoods through semantic segmentation maps, we are able to observe how these factors affect cell-cell interactions simultaneously in different protein channels. Furthermore, we design a set of metrics and offer the first insights towards cell spatial orientations, cell protein expressions, and cell neighborhoods. Our model, cell-cell interaction GAN (CCIGAN), outperforms or matches existing image synthesis methods on all conventional measures and significantly outperforms on biologically motivated metrics. To our knowledge, we are the first to systematically model multiple cellular protein behaviors and interactions under simulated conditions through image synthesis.","We explore cell-cell interactions across tumor environment contexts observed in highly multiplexed images, by image synthesis using a novel attention GAN architecture.","Daniel Li,Qiang Ma,Andrew Liu,Justin Cheung,Dana Pe’er,Itsik Pe’er","Computational biology,image synthesis,GANs,exploring multiplex images,attention,interpretability",--,--,1442,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Byg9AR4YDB,['ICLR.cc/2020/Conference'],"@misc{

SyAbZb-0Z,Transfer Learning to Learn with Multitask Neural Model Search,https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyAbZb-0Z,--,"Deep learning models require extensive architecture design exploration and hyperparameter optimization to perform well on a given task. The exploration of the model design space is often made by a human expert, and optimized using a combination of grid search and search heuristics over a large space of possible choices. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a Reinforcement Learning approach that has been proposed to automate architecture design. NAS has been successfully applied to generate Neural Networks that rival the best human-designed architectures. However, NAS requires sampling, constructing, and training hundreds to thousands of models to achieve well-performing architectures. This procedure needs to be executed from scratch for each new task. The application of NAS to a wide set of tasks currently lacks a way to transfer generalizable knowledge across tasks.
In this paper, we present the Multitask Neural Model Search (MNMS) controller. Our goal is to learn a generalizable framework that can condition model construction on successful model searches for previously seen tasks, thus significantly speeding up the search for new tasks. We demonstrate that MNMS can conduct an automated architecture search for multiple tasks simultaneously while still learning well-performing, specialized models for each task. We then show that pre-trained MNMS controllers can transfer learning to new tasks. By leveraging knowledge from previous searches, we find that pre-trained MNMS models start from a better location in the search space and reduce search time on unseen tasks, while still discovering models that outperform published human-designed models.","We present Multitask Neural Model Search, a Meta-learner that can design models for multiple tasks simultaneously and transfer learning to unseen tasks.","Catherine Wong,Andrea Gesmundo","Learning to Learn,Meta learning,Reinforcement learning,Transfer learning",--,--,649,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyAbZb-0Z,['ICLR.cc/2018/Conference'],"@misc{
